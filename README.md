🔬 Molecular Solubility Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses the Delaney dataset to predict the solubility of molecules using a regression model built with scikit-learn in Google Colab. Solubility is a key factor in drug discovery, helping biologists and chemists assess whether a molecule is a viable drug candidate. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can be used in cheminformatics for real-world applications.

📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the Delaney dataset (Solubility dataset), which contains molecular descriptors and experimental log solubility values (LogS) of various compounds.

📌 Features: 
Molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds)

🎯 Target: 
Experimental LogS (log solubility in mols/liter)

📊 Tools & Libraries Used

Python 3
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
scikit-learn for building ML models
Google Colab (for training and visualization)

📈 Model Overview

Model: Linear Regression
Target: Predict LogS (log solubility) of molecules

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score

🤔 Why This Matters
Accurate prediction of solubility helps scientists:

Prioritize compounds for synthesis
Reduce experimental costs
Speed up drug development pipelines
